# iOS Russian Flashcard App

This is a simple flashcard app for learning basic Russian vocabulary and grammar rules around forming words.

Two notes:
- This is a hobby project mostly made over a single weekend, and is not intended to be a full-featured language learning app of value for anyone besides me.
- I am learning Russian as my in-laws speak it due to a fluke of geopolitical history and Soviet imperialism. [Support Ukraine](https://war.ukraine.ua/donate/) any way you can.
