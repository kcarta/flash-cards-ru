# Expressing Time and Dates in Russian

Understanding how to express time and dates in Russian involves not only memorizing the names of days and months but also grasping the grammatical rules for word forms, endings, and case usage.

## Days of the Week

The days of the week in Russian are not capitalized and are generally used in the nominative case.

- Понедельник (Monday)
- Вторник (Tuesday)
- Среда (Wednesday)
- Четверг (Thursday)
- Пятница (Friday)
- Суббота (Saturday)
- Воскресенье (Sunday)

## Months of the Year

Months in Russian are also not capitalized and are used in the nominative case for stating dates. They decline in cases based on their usage in sentences.

- Январь (January)
- Февраль (February)
- Март (March)
- Апрель (April)
- Май (May)
- Июнь (June)
- Июль (July)
- Август (August)
- Сентябрь (September)
- Октябрь (October)
- Ноябрь (November)
- Декабрь (December)

## Expressing Time

When expressing time, the hours are stated in the nominative case, while minutes are typically in the genitive case due to the preposition "минут" (minutes past the hour).

- **Час (Hour)**: Singular form for one o'clock is "час" (1 час).
- **Часы (Hours)**: For hours two through four, use the genitive singular form (2, 3, 4 часа). For five through twelve, use the genitive plural form (5–12 часов).

### Examples

- 3:15 - Три часа пятнадцать минут.
- 1:30 - Полтора часа (1:30 is expressed as "one and a half hours" in Russian).

## Expressing Dates

Dates in Russian are expressed with cardinal numbers in the genitive case due to the preposition "число" (number, date).

- 1-го января (January 1st)
- 23-го февраля (February 23rd)

### Examples

- Мой день рождения 12-го апреля. (My birthday is April 12th.)
- Новый год отмечается 1-го января. (New Year is celebrated on January 1st.)

## Prepositions for Time and Dates

- **В**: Used with months and seasons, indicating "in" (в январе - in January).
- **На**: Used with parts of the day, excluding ночь (night) (на утро - in the morning).
- **К**: Indicating "by the time" (к пяти часам - by five o'clock).

## Special Cases

- When referring to the first day of the month, "первое" is used in the neuter singular form, as in "первое мая" (May 1st).
- For expressing decades, use the plural genitive form, as in "в девяностых годах" (in the 1990s).

Understanding these rules and patterns will help accurately express time and dates in Russian, enhancing communication and comprehension in everyday and formal contexts.
