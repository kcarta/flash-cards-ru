Numbers in Russian, both cardinal and ordinal, have specific forms and endings that change based on gender, case, and usage in sentences. Understanding these nuances is essential for accurate communication.

## Cardinal Numbers

Cardinal numbers in Russian are used to indicate quantity and follow specific declension patterns, especially for numbers 1 through 4, which agree with the noun in gender and number.

### 1 (Один, Одна, Одно)

- Masculine: Один (дом - one house)
- Feminine: Одна (книга - one book)
- Neuter: Одно (окно - one window)

### 2 (Два, Две)

- Masculine/Neuter: Два (два стола - two tables)
- Feminine: Две (две двери - two doors)

### 3+

Invariant across genders but take the genitive singular form of the noun.

- Три моста (three bridges)
- Четыре угла (four corners)

Numbers 5 through 20 require the noun to be in the genitive plural. 

## Compound numbers

Compound numbers (21, 22, 31, etc.) follow the pattern of their last digit in terms of gender agreement and case usage.

## Declension of Numbers

Russian numbers decline based on cases, particularly noticeable with numbers ending in 1 (except 11), where the noun takes the genitive singular, and numbers ending in 2, 3, or 4 (except 12, 13, 14), where the noun takes the genitive plural.

## Ordinal Numbers

Ordinal numbers in Russian indicate order or position. They agree with the noun they modify in gender, number, and case, behaving like adjectives.

- **First**: Первый (M), Первая (F), Первое (N), Первые (Pl)
- **Second**: Второй (M), Вторая (F), Второе (N), Вторые (Pl)
- **Third**: Третий (M), Третья (F), Третье (N), Третьи (Pl)

Ordinal numbers from the fourth onward are typically formed by adding the suffix -ый to the cardinal number base, with necessary adjustments for gender and case endings.

### Examples

- Пятый урок (The fifth lesson)
- Десятая страница (The tenth page)
- Сотый раз (The hundredth time)

## Special Considerations

- The number "один" (one) has a short form "одиннадцать" (eleven) and "двадцать один" (twenty-one) where it behaves like an adjective and agrees with the noun in gender.
- Compound numbers from 21 onwards are formed by stating the tens, followed by the units, e.g., "двадцать один" (twenty-one), "тридцать два" (thirty-two), adjusting for gender if the unit is 1 or 2.
- Large numbers (thousands, millions) follow specific patterns: "тысяча" (thousand) is feminine and declines like a feminine noun, while "миллион" (million) and "миллиард" (billion) are masculine and follow the declension pattern of masculine nouns.

Understanding the intricacies of Russian numbers, including their forms and agreements, is key to mastering the language, especially for practical applications like dates, quantities, and positions.
