# Russian Nouns

Russian nouns are characterized by their gender, number, and case. They form the backbone of Russian sentences, representing subjects, objects, and indirect objects. Understanding their properties and declensions is fundamental for mastering Russian grammar.

## Gender

Russian nouns are categorized into three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. Gender affects the adjective agreement and verb conjugation.

- **Masculine**: Usually end in a consonant or -й (дом - house, стол - table).
- **Feminine**: Typically end in -а or -я (мама - mother, книга - book).
- **Neuter**: Often end in -о or -е (окно - window, море - sea).

## Number

Nouns can be singular or plural. Plural formation varies and includes changes in the noun's ending.

- Singular: стол (table)
- Plural: столы (tables)

### Plural Formation Rules

- If a noun ends in a hard consonant, add -ы (дом - дома).
- If a noun ends in -й or a soft sign, replace it with -и (ночь - ночи).
- Neuter nouns ending in -о or -е change to -а or -я (окно - окна).

## Cases

Russian nouns decline in six cases, each serving different syntactical functions and answering specific questions.

### Nominative Case (Именительный падеж)

- Used for the subject of a sentence.

### Accusative Case (Винительный падеж)

- Used for the direct object of a sentence.

## Special Nouns

Some nouns have irregular plural forms or behave differently in certain cases, often requiring memorization.

## Animate vs. Inanimate Nouns

- Animate nouns (referring to living beings) often have a different accusative form, resembling the genitive case.
- Inanimate nouns use the same form for nominative and accusative cases.

## Declension Groups

Russian nouns are divided into declension groups based on their endings and gender, each following specific patterns for case changes.

Understanding Russian nouns involves not just memorizing their gender, plurality, and cases but also practicing their usage in various contexts to grasp their declension patterns and syntactical roles fully.
